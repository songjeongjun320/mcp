## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Integration Pattern
All Phase 2 tools follow a consistent integration pattern:

```python
# Async/Sync Wrapper Pattern
async def tool_function(organization_id: str, message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # MCP client integration
    # Error handling and fallback mechanisms
    # Structured response with analytics

def tool_function_sync(organization_id: str, message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Synchronous wrapper for FastMCP compatibility
```

### MCP Server Configuration
Each tool integrates with its respective MCP server:

```python
MCP_SERVERS_CONFIG = {
    'n8n': {
        'enabled': os.environ.get('N8N_MCP_ENABLED', 'false').lower() == 'true',
        'server_url': os.environ.get('N8N_SERVER_URL', 'http://localhost:5678'),
        'api_key': os.environ.get('N8N_API_KEY', ''),
        'webhook_base_url': os.environ.get('N8N_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL', 'http://localhost:5678')
    },
    # ... other servers
}
```

### Security Features
- Organization-level data isolation
- Secure API key management
